PATIENT.2048
==========

A working port of [iOS-2048](https://github.com/austinzheng/iOS-2048) to Apple's Swift language.

Like the original Objective-C version, swift-2048 does not rely upon SpriteKit. See the description for iOS-2048 for more information.

Thoughts on Swift

If you really want to see my out-of-date thoughts on Swift, check out the git history for `README.md`.
